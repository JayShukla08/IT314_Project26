Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs of Library Information System:

Functional requirements-

1. Any user should be able to browse freely through the catalog of books available.

2. The user should be able to search for any particular book that he/she wants.

3. Any new user should be provided the option to become a member.

4. The member should be able to borrow the book that he/she wants from his/her desk using LIS for a limited borrowing time.

5. The member should be able to return the book that he/she has issued and now no longer needs.

6. A member should be able to make a booking for any particular book that is not available at the time of issuing.

7. The member should be able to extend the date of borrowing the book that he/she has issued if no other booking for that book has been made.

8. The system should be able to keep track of day-to-day transactions to ease the work of library staff.

9. The librarian should have administrative privileges over the LIS.

10. The librarian should be able to make a new record into the system when any book has been purchased.

11. The librarian should be able to remove the record of a book from the system when the book has been taken off the shelf (removed from the library).

12. The librarian should have complete control over the system so that he can alter the record however he/she wants.

Non-Functional requirements-

1. The system should have a user-friendly interface to ease the process of the user.

2. The system should be reliable i.e. it should provide correct outputs to user actions in some given time t.

3. The system should have good performance and low-latency so that it can give a quick response and real-time response to the user's actions.

4. The system should be able to differentiate between normal users and members (valid users) of the system and should provide the functionality of issuing and returning to members only.

5. The system should be easy to use so that any inexperienced user can efficiently access the system.

6. The system should have good scalability i.e. it should be able to provide good performance on increase in the number of users of the system.

7. The system should be maintainable i.e. it should not crash on increase in the number of users or increase in number of book records in the system.

8. The system should be robust and should be able to provide data-backup in case of system crashes.

9. The system should provide privacy to the users so that no confidential information (like passwords) gets displayed in plain text.

10. The system should provide user authentication so that only authorized users can access the system and make purchases.
That way only the authorized librarian should be able to make changes to the system. 


Q.2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.

Scope & Features:

Our mobile application should be an impactful solution for the worldwide problem of disabling hearing-loss. The application should be able to answer the key everyday needs of this community. The application should inculcate Artificial Intelligence(AI) into the system working. Using AI, the application should recognize key sound effects and alert the user immediately. 

The application would have a large number of users so the application should be very easy to use even for the inexperienced user. The application is aimed as a solution for a serious problem so it should have little to no latency and should provide responses to users in real-time.

The application should capture the real-time sounds in the environment (car horns, baby crying, announcements made at any transportation station, etc). The system should be able to differentiate between different sounds and alert the user of the sound accordingly. The system can have a captions option so that the user can read the captions and realize the sound that was made accordingly. 

Functional and non-functional requirements:

Any user should be able to login into the system and access the applicationâ€™s facilities.

The application should be able to recognize the sounds using AI with accuracy and alert the user accordingly.

The application should be able to differentiate between different sounds and recognize them accordingly.

The application should have the functionality of displaying the speech of others to users on their mobiles as captions. 

For people who converse in sign languages, the application should communicate with them accordingly. 

The application should alert the users in case of emergency sounds like fire alarms or earthquakes by vibrating or by flashing lights to capture the attention of users.

Disabling hearing loss is a worldwide problem so the application should be such that any person from any community is able to use it efficiently.

The application should have a very simple and friendly user-interface to ease the process of the users.

The application should have good scalability so that it works efficiently even for a large number of users.

The application should be secure and should provide privacy to the user and not display or leak his/her private information to others.

The system should operate in real-time.

The system should be robust and in case of crashes the data recovery should happen accordingly.
